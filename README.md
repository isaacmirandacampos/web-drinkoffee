# It's my personal website | Drinkoffee

Created with Astro to train my skills, and to have a place to share my thoughts and projects.

Initially I started the project to learn about Astro and TailwindCSS to understand the technologies, but then I liked the idea of using the project for a portfolio.

## Technologies used

- Astro
- TailwindCSS
- TypeScript

## Deployed

The website is hosted on Netlify, and can be accessed [here](https://www.drinkoffee.com)

## How to run

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

## In progress

I am now working on other personal content to add more information to my website. Most of the content about my work is included in professional jobs.
