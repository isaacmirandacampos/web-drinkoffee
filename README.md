# It's my personal website

Created with astro to training my skills, and to have a place to share my thoughts and projects.

Initially I'm started the project to learn about Astro and TailwindCSS to understand the technologies, but then I liked the idea of using the project for a portfolio.

## Technologies used

- Astro
- TailwindCSS
- TypeScript

## Deploy

The website is deployed on Netlify, and you can access it [here](https://www.drinkoffee.com)

## How to run

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```
